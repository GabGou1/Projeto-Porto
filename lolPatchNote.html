            <h2>Nerfs</h2>
            <h4>Annie</h4>
            <p>
                Annie is currently one of the most popular champions in Pro play and she’s skipping along just fine in solo queue. This is due to how consistent of a pick she is because of her solid early game and strong scaling. Our goal with nerfing her Q is to tone down some of her guaranteed damage and make getting to late game just a tad more difficult.
            </p>
            <h4>Aphelios</h4>
            <p>
                Aphelios is the #1 bot laner in pro play by a long shot and has been a top performer since March. As such, we want to act in order to create more variety in the bottom lane. We know it sucks for players at home to catch strays like this, but he’s still in a much stronger spot than he was at the start of the year. This time around, we’re targeting some of his biggest ability outliers that provide frustrating levels of power: His turret deals too much DPS for a basic ability, Infernum Q provides him best-in-class sustain by a large margin, and Gravitum’s gank setup is very high for a basic ability.
            </p>
            <h4>Ivern</h4>
            <p>
                Ivern has been taking root across all skill levels after his 13.11 updates which have resulted in one terrifying tree that makes Maokai look like a Meowkai. We feel that his ability to poke down targets at a safe distance and chase down enemies with Daisy are out of line, so we're pulling back on some of Daisy's damage and mobility while also toning down the on-hit damage he gains from Brushmaker.
            </p>
            <h4>Kindread</h4>
            <p>
                Kindred are elite-skewed junglers that are winning far too often in the top levels of ranked play. While Trinity Force is a strong item in their inventory, they've got other well-performing items such as Kraken Slayer, so we're targeting direct nerfs to Kindred themselves. We're specifically addressing their early invading and dueling potential. In the hands of less-comfortable Kindred players, the W passive healing is still strong and should soften the blow of these armor nerfs while clearing their own jungle.
            </p>
            <h4>Neeko</h4>
            <p>
                In Pro play Neeko is excellent at getting early advantages and snowballing them. We like her ability to win lanes, but she's winning them a bit too hard at the moment. With these changes we're looking to bring down Neeko's laning power and create some more counterplay opportunities for her ultimate. In exchange, we do want to give a little bit of power back to her on-hit builds to compensate for its early nerfs.
            </p>
            <p>
                We're still monitoring how Neeko's disguise interactions should function longterm and deciding if there are any cases we're not okay with. New kinds of interactions like this will create some frustration for players, but we want to make sure it's reasonable and happening at the right times.
            </p>
            <h4>Rek'Sai</h4>
            <p>
                We're happy to see that updates to Rek'Sai's passive healing and Queen's Wrath ability in 13.11 have shifted her into a fighter pattern, but we feel that her ability to clear camps and shrug off damage during skirmishes is too strong. To address this, we're reducing some of Rek’Sai’s stats to slow her down in the Jungle and reduce the safety of her engages. You pop off queen, just a little bit less please.
            </p>
            <h4>Varus</h4>
            <p>
                AP Varus has been causing quite the ruckus recently, especially in top lane. It's certainly an interesting build, and quite strong, but his unique niche is "I deal 1000 + 60% of your maximum health at 1200 range." We're glad that he cares about Blight stacks, but it's just too much maximum health damage. We're hoping to keep all Varus builds viable while giving high-health champions more of a fighting chance against his high damage AP combos.
            </p>
            <h4>Vi</h4>
            <p>
                Vi has had the highest Pro presence out of any Champion this season. This is in part due to her having very reliable CC with her ultimate which is especially beneficial in coordinated Pro play. We're nerfing her R cooldown to reduce its uptime while maintaining its power when casted correctly. We're also reducing the shield scaling on her passive to nerf her durability. This will reduce her synergy with Radiant Virtue, which Pros purchase virtually every game on Vi, whereas in solo queue it has a much lower purchase rate.
            </p>
            <h4>Wukong</h4>
            <p>
                Wukong is relatively weak for most players, but still maintains a high presence in Pro, so we're going to be nerfing him in a way that will impact his performance at the highest skill level. We're aiming to reduce Wukong's jungle clear speed as this will be both jungle- and Pro-skewed while having minimal impact on his performance in Top Lane, which is already on the weaker side. To achieve this, we are removing the monster modifier on Nimbus Strike.
            </p>
            <h2>Buffs</h2>
            <h4>Lee Sin</h4>
            <p>
                Lee Sin has been in a fairly weak spot in solo queue and he hasn't been seen much play in Pro either (where he's often picked despite his solo queue win rate). We're specifically increasing the scaling on his Q in order to make landing it more rewarding in later stages of the game, where it's difficult to land and risky to take during large teamfights.
            </p>
            <h4>Nidalee</h4>
            <p>
                Nidalee is an exciting champion when she's played at high skill levels, however she's all but disappeared from the jungle at the highest levels of play. In order to bring her out, we're looking to give her a small movement speed buff which is especially helpful to Nidalee both in her human and cougar form.
            </p>
            <h2>Ajustes</h2>
            <h4>Rell</h4>
            <p>
                Rell Support has been dominating recently. We’re targeting her durability here as we think her overall gameplay pattern is in a good place.
            </p>
            <p>
                Meanwhile, the updates to Rell’s jungle monster modifiers hit a bit too hard, and Rell Jungle (Rungle? Rungle.) is struggling, so we’re upping her mods on Q and E. This should make Q the clear best first max for Rungle (which was already true but many Rells weren’t running it). We’re also flattening out the attack speed buff from her dismounted form, so it’s not something junglers are wondering if they should max. We’re glad you’re enjoying Rell though and we’ll be continuing to keep an eye on her as her midscope settles into place.
            </p>
            <h4>Anivia</h4>
            <p>
                Fixed a bug where Anivia would not regain her non-Eggnivia armor and MR stats immediately after reviving
